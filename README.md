application and there will be option to update individual courses, delete courses, search courses and store

## Project Solution Design:

It is a console-based project with no database connection, so a list is created first and all information is stored
in the file via file write or append. When data is required, it is also read from the same file. First, a module
named function is created for writing all functions, and the module is imported into the home file where the
main code is written. When the code is executed, it first prints what the user enters for which work. The user
has six options.
